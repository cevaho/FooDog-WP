## Project

* [Becode Project description](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Johnson-3.9/tree/master/Projets/Foodog)
* [Trello project management link](https://trello.com/b/gK9YRqhr/wp-project)

Based on [Understrap](https://wordpress.org/themes/understrap/) empty wordpress template
 
* designing a new template that would become a copy of [Digest, the Farmer's Dog](http://digest.thefarmersdog.com/)
* learning how to show articles depending on bootstrap design, categories, search results with wordpress function
* the functionalities work but the design still has to be done (the main structure is designed)

* The template can be seen [here](http://wordpress.cevaho-creation.be/)
* The seo lightHouse test can be read [here](https://github.com/cevaho/FooDog-WP/blob/master/foodog-Lighthouse-Report.pdf)

 I practiced more:

* trello project management
* bootstrap with wordpress
* custom multiple loops to display wordpress articles

Templates created:

* category.php (didn't exist and was created not to replace the archive template)
* cinqgrid.php (to display 5 article with a complex grid system)
* searchor.php (to show the searchbar in a custom modal pop-up)
* featuredpost.php (to change de layout of the featurd articles in index.php)

Templates modified:

* index.php
* single.php
* searchForm.php
* header.php
* footer.php
* function.php (to create a function that shows the most popular posts in the footer based on view count)


## Author
We were 3 at the beginning but other people prefered doing other projects, that's why rules about project management and Github flow weren't followed.


### Notes
I should have finished the design but in the same time I had to recreate the database and some pages of another wordpress site : [hbim.be](https://www.hbim.be/) that were on my hosting with too old plugins.

Instragram hasn't been added due to the fact that I didn't have it on my cellphone and the only way to upload images on instagram requires to take pictures from a smartphone, not a desktop.

I haven't activated indexing site by robots as it's a test template with content that I don't own.
